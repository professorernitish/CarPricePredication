# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Web App

This project is a web-based machine learning application that predicts the selling price of a car based on various input features like car brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, and more. It uses a trained Random Forest model and is built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **HTML**.
